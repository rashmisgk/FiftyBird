Hello, I'm Rashmi, and I'm excited to share a game that I've created. This game is the result of my participation in CS50's 'Introduction to
Game Development' course, where I gained valuable knowledge from tutorials.

My game is inspired by the famous game called Flappy Bird, but I've made some exciting changes to enhance the gameplay. 
Here are the modifications I've made:

1) I've introduced random spacing between each set of pipes and adjusted the gap between the top and bottom pipes, adding an element of unpredictability.
2) I've implemented a medal system to reward players when they achieve specific scores. Aim high and collect those medals!
3) Additionally, I've added a pause button, allowing you to pause the game whenever life gets in the way. Take a break and resume whenever 
   you're ready.

Throughout the development process, I utilized LOVE2D, an excellent program that offers a robust environment for game development. 
I hope you thoroughly enjoy playing this game! Have fun, and feel free to customize it further to your liking!
